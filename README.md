# touch-sensitive
*a simple face-touch detector*

A circuit designed to sound an alarm when you touch your face. The idea being to train you to do it less often, hence reducing the transfer of infectious microbes from your hands to your mouth/nose/eyes.

Inspired by Dr Daniel Reardon ([Astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/astrophysicist-gets-magnets-stuck-up-nose-while-inventing-coronavirus-device)).

This is a quick-and-dirty proof of concept, essentially a magnet-coil movement detector. The sensor has two parts: a small coil hung around the user's neck, and a small magnet taped to their wrist. When the magnet moves near the coil, the circuit emits a bleep.

Here's a rough video demonstrating it in action:
